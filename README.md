## Still don't know how to do what you want?
You can submit [issues](https://github.com/DNin01/help-for-github-users/issues) to talk about something that you think many GitHub users probably don't know how to do and that is hard to find an answer to so that I can answer the question (if I know what the answer is, of course). If you find your question in an existing issue and you have the same question, you can üëç it.
