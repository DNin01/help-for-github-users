# Modifying multiple files with one commit

If you commit your changes on the GitHub website, you probably know how the UI only lets you edit one file per commit, so in order to edit multiple files, you have to commit each edit separately. However, there are other ways to commit that let you modify multiple files in the same commit.

### [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)

Git is a command line tool that you can use to push changes from your computer to your GitHub repository.

### [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop)

GitHub Desktop is a graphical user interface that uses Git behind the scenes.

### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

VS Code is a code editor and it [comes with support for Git features](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview).

### [The github.dev web-based editor](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor)

It's basically VS Code on the web. It also comes with all the features you'll need to commit to GitHub repositories, so no setup is required - you just fire it up and edit.
