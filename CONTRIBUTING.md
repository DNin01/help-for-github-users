You can help the project out in several ways:

## Send feedback

### Create an [issue](https://github.com/DNin01/help-for-github-users/issues) to suggest answering a frequently asked question
The purpose of this repository is to answer frequent questions that GitHub users have. If you've got a frequently asked question, you can create an issue to mention it to me, suggesting that I answer the question (or answer it yourself, too).

## Send pull requests

With pull requests, you can actually make any of the above changes for me. Contributions are welcome!

**If you feel that the changes you're making need discussion (for example, you're making a change that may or may not be accepted or may have better alternative solutions), [create an issue first](https://github.com/DNin01/help-for-github-users/issues/new/choose) so that we have time to figure out what to do (and if we should do anything), and then you can make your pull request.**

### How to make a pull request
If you don't know how to send a pull request, I'll walk you through. Most of the time, you won't need to write any code or install any software.
1. [Create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) if you haven't already. Just click Fork at the top-right of the page. This will make a copy of the repository for you to edit.
2. [Make sure the `main` branch is up to date](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork). Click "Sync fork" then "Update branch". This will bring the latest changes from the origin repository into your fork.

After you've got your fork ready to go, let's perform the next steps also using the website (or feel free to use Git or your code editor if you are comfortable).

3. [Create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository#creating-a-branch). You'll make your changes to this branch. This is very helpful as it lets you have multiple pull requests at once and you won't have to worry about resetting your branch when syncing your fork.
4. Make your changes. [Edit](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/editing-files) or [create](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/creating-new-files) files then click Commit changes.
5. Going back to the [origin repository](https://github.com/DNin01/help-for-github-users), you should see a message saying that your branch recently had commits. Click "Compare and pull request".
6. Click "Create pull request" and fill out the form. Click "Create pull request" again when you're done.
7. We'll review your changes shortly and update you when we approve your changes.

#### Tips when contributing
- If you plan to keep making changes, keep your fork after the pull request is merged. You can reuse it to make more branches and pull requests. Sync it if needed whenever you have changes to make.
- Make sure each pull request has a different purpose. That way, we don't have to merge a bunch of different changes at once and risk some of them being rejected.
